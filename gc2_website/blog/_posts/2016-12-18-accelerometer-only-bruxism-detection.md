When I set out to work on this project, the Myoware muscle sensor was deemed to be an essential component, necessary to sense muscle activity and gauge the level of night-time bruxism activity. My 2013 project also used an EMG sensor, the Muscle Sensor v3. A lot of people who attempt to build bruxism devices (as is the case for a few members on the bruxhackers mailing list) independently come to the same conclusion, that an EMG sensor is ideal for a bruxism device.

And there a lot of things that seemed very positive about the Myoware, which I <a href="/2015/10/01/designing-new-device/">wrote about</a>:

 * **Doesnâ€™t require a dual power supply:** can be powered from a +3.3V input
 * **Has electrode snaps directly on the PCB**, which makes wires short and as a result is less susceptible to interference.
 * **Very small in size**: can be stuck directly on the face.
