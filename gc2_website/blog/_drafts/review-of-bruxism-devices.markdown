title: "Review of Bruxism Devices on the market"

There are a number of devices that help monitor or attempt to prevent bruxism on the market. Most of them use an [EMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography) sensor to detect muscle activation, either on the temporal muscle or the masseter muscle. 

Readily available devices
=========================

These devices should be readily available for anyone to purchase now.

I purchased a Grindcare in September 2012 after coming across their website. The

Plans for Sleeptrack device
===========================

With so many devices on the market or in development, why build another one ? Here are some of the ways in which Sleeptrack is different:

* **Open source, extensible platform**: both the hardware and software (device firmware, web app and analytics) will be open source. Also, the InfluxDB data repository which stores the time-series data generated by the device will be available for anyone to run queries against.
* **Wireless and cloud-enabled**: while as some of the devices listed above are offline-only, only providing some data through their LCD screens, some allow PC connectivity, but the data remains inside their proprietary app. The sleeptrack device will upload data to the cloud throughout the night and allow consulting the results through the webapp. This convenience allows regular monitoring and doesn't require the user to periodically download the data.
* **Extremely detailed data**: while a nighly summary of bruxism activity is provided, the user can know exactly when bruxism activity happened, when head movement happened. The sleeptrack device measures all activity 10 times/second and publishes all the data. Anyone who has an analytical mind should enjoy using this device. This is in contrast to the Grindcare and Sleepguard devices which only provide number of grind events.
* **IMU on board**: the device has an IMU (Inertial Measurment Unit) which tracks the position of the head throughout the night. In addition to providing sleeping position data, it will help determine whether the user is asleep or woken up.
* **Audio and Vibration alerting**: the device will have a configurable alarm threshold and provide a choice of audio alerting through headphones, with configurable volume (quiet to very loud) which will make it impossible for the user to ignore the alert. A vibration feature is currently in development. Whether bruxism responds well to biofeedback conditionning or not is difficult to prove. However it's abundantly clear that for some patients, the bruxism activity must be stopped at all costs (even at the cost of sleep quality), and the alerting feature on the Sleeptrack is built for that purpose.
* **Worn on headband**: the device is worn on a headband with the EMG sensor connected by a wire. All of the hardware is worn on the head. This allows for free neck movement, as there are no wires going to other parts of the body. Other devices worn around the neck tend to constrain head movement for fear of pulling on the wires.
