Breakout Board
==============

Objective: allow us to solder all of the SMD components on a single board, and connect jumper cables to form a circuit using breadboards.

All of the components should expose their pins into through-holes with 0.1" spacing so that we can use these female headers: https://www.adafruit.com/products/598

Might be good to have properly marked pins along the header to know what we're connecting. But this board doesn't need to look pretty.
