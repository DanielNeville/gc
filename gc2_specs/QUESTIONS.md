* molex connector for EMG sensor: the one on the kickstarter looks different
* 2 pos slide switch (SS12SDH2) on the arduino prototype, it felt like input and output were briefly shorted
* SPDT push button: can't tell from the image what the orientation will be ? should be same as 2 pos slide switch
* on/off switch: yes I need that, to open close the battery circuit
* the MAX6160L circuit you show seems complicated, it looked like there were other choices for mono
* JTAG: not sure, however the push buttons and RGB LED seem like a must
