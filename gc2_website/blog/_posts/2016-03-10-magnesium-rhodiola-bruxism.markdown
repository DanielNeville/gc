Our body needs magnesium to stay healthy. Without it, our regulated blood pressure becomes unstable and our heart develops unhealthy complications. Plus, magnesium is great for our bones and nerves as well. The easy way to get magnesium into the body is through our diet by eating almonds, sunflower seeds, or potatoes with the skin. And don’t forget about earthy greens like spinach.

Interestingly, Bruxism sufferers benefit from added magnesium. Although mechanisms aren’t clear, the effects of magnesium with Bruxism may be connected to NMDA. Magnesium is one of the only well-proven compounds in Bruxism. In fact, it’s believed lack of magnesium is one of the primary reason Bruxism develops.  Magnesium is linked to nerve and muscle function. A magnesium-deficient diet can cause teeth grinding and prolonged magnesium therapy can lead to a cure (Lehvila, 1994). But once the magnesium supplements stop, Bruxism symptoms can return. 

Here’s the thing: it’s very easy for the body to develop a magnesium deficiency. Certain activities and foods can render the magnesium we absorb completely worthless. For example, dark sodas bind with magnesium and flushes it out of our bodies. And tons of sugar from junk foods lead to the kidneys to dispense magnesium. But the benefits are stripped immediately in the process.

So many Bruxism sufferers don’t have enough magnesium in their body. This is why they begin magnesium therapy. Magnesium supplements don’t require a prescription. You can pick them up at your local market. But – and this can’t be stressed enough – you have to monitor your intake! Too much magnesium can cause adverse responses. A conversation with your doctor is recommended before you begin magnesium therapy. 

You also can’t expect to take a few magnesium supplements and see results immediately. As one man who has taken magnesium for Bruxism, Carlos from the Bruxhackers mailing list says “the accumulation of magnesium in tissue is something that takes months or even years… not just once gives you enough.”

But the biggest issue with magnesium therapy is it’s not guaranteed to lift Bruxism symptoms. If you suffer from extreme Bruxism, you may not feel much relief after years of taking supplements. Daniel, a fellow member of the Bruxhackers mailing list, has taken magnesium for one year says, “I've been on magnesium pretty consistently for the past year, and I can't say there's been much difference other than the toilet.”

An interesting connection: people who didn’t see much change by taking magnesium did see a difference in their Bruxism symptoms when they took the herb rhodiola rosea. Another person stated, “cannot say [magnesium] helped. I couldn't find a relation between improvement and intake. But I have success with rhodiola rosea.”

The reason people see relief from Bruxism when taking rhodiola rosea is widely unknown. But rhodiola rosea is often used in supplements for anti-fatigue and improving stress symptoms. As we know, stress is linked to Bruxism, but simply telling someone to “stop stressing” isn’t going to cure Bruxism.  

You can take magnesium and rhodiola rosea together, but the two don’t boost the power of each other. Instead, taking both simultaneously could make it difficult to decipher which one, if any, have stopped providing relief. 

Relief start to dwindle as an tolerance to rhodiola rosea builds. When this happens, and it will as you continue to take the supplements, you’ll be required to take higher dosages just to feel some relief. 

Luckily you can “cycle” tolerance. Stop taking rhodiola rosea for a few weeks and you may regain some of the effects once you begin taking it again. It’s not guaranteed, but it doesn’t hurt to try. 

So, although rhodiola rosea can limit or minimize Bruxism symptoms, it is not a cure or even a long-term solution. 

We know magnesium and rhodiola rosea both have capabilities to minimize the symptoms of bruxism, but it is not a fix for everyone. For those who say magnesium has helped, they have used it for many months or even years, and adjusted dosages throughout that duration. It’s a very trial and error process, because it’s not a universal method to cure Bruxism, and each person’s body is different. 

When taking rhodiola rosea, many people felt a difference with their Bruxism symptoms. More so than with magnesium therapy. But rhodiola rosea tolerance build up is quick. Still, for temporary relief, this could be a start towards the right direction for you. 

But it needs to be stated once again: always discuss diet and supplement changes with your doctor before beginning self-therapy treatments. Never substitute the changes with medical prescriptions or advice, unless warranted by your doctor.
